## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Mathematical Consistency ✅

**Before**: Impossible claim
```
索引延迟 < 5秒 + 等待12个确认块
(5 seconds < 144 seconds ❌)
```

**After**: Configurable and accurate
```yaml
Confirmation Modes:
  - Realtime (1 block):  ~12 seconds
  - Balanced (6 blocks): ~72 seconds  ← Default
  - Safe (12 blocks):    ~144 seconds
```

### 2. Cost Clarity ✅

**Before**: Confusing and expensive
```
"需要投入 $49-99/月 购买专业RPC服务"
"不要寄希望于免费RPC端点"
```

**After**: Clear and affordable
```yaml
Portfolio (Default):
  Cost: $0-5/月
  RPC: Alchemy Free (300M CU/月)
  Database: Supabase Free (500MB)
  Cache: Upstash Free (10K/day)
  Hosting: Railway $5/月

Production (Optional):
  Cost: $100+/月
  Upgrade when: Real users + revenue
```

### 3. Scope Definition ✅

**Before**: Unclear what's in/out
```
- WebSocket subscriptions mentioned in schema
- Multi-chain support implied
- Advanced features mixed with MVP
```

**After**: Crystal clear
```yaml
MVP (Phase 1-5):
  ✅ Core event indexing
  ✅ GraphQL API
  ✅ Microservices architecture
  ✅ Free tier deployment

Future (Phase 6+):
  ⏭️ WebSocket subscriptions
  ⏭️ Multi-chain support
  ⏭️ Advanced analytics
  ⏭️ Enterprise features
```

### 4. Database Integrity ✅

**Before**: Potential data corruption
```sql
CREATE TABLE indexer_state (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,           -- ❌ Redundant
    contract_id INTEGER,              -- ❌ Not unique
    ...
);
-- Could have duplicate states per contract!
```

**After**: Guaranteed uniqueness
```sql
CREATE TABLE indexer_state (
    contract_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,  -- ✅ One state per contract
    ...
);
```

### 5. Project Positioning ✅

**Before**: Generic/production-focused
```
高性能的智能合约事件索引服务...
```

**After**: Clear portfolio focus
```markdown
**项目定位**: 🎯 **Portfolio/技能展示项目**
- 展示 Web3 开发技能
- 展示微服务架构能力
- **优先使用免费服务降低成本**
- 目标成本: $0-5/月
```

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Confirmation Block Strategy

**Decision**: Configurable per contract (1/6/12 blocks)  
**Default**: 6 blocks (balanced mode)  
**Rationale**: 
- Flexibility for different use cases
- Industry standard (Alchemy, Infura)
- Clear speed vs safety tradeoff

### 2. Free Tier Stack

**Decision**: Railway + Supabase + Upstash + Alchemy  
**Cost**: $0-5/月  
**Rationale**:
- All have generous free tiers
- Easy to set up and deploy
- Production-ready infrastructure
- Seamless upgrade path

### 3. Database Schema

**Decision**: `indexer_state.contract_id` as PRIMARY KEY  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents duplicate state records
- Simpler than separate `id` field
- Better performance (no need for UNIQUE index)

### 4. Scope Management

**Decision**: WebSocket subscriptions = Phase 6+  
**Rationale**:
- Not critical for portfolio demo
- Adds complexity without much value
- Can discuss as extensibility in interviews
- Architecture already supports it

### 5. Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Railway.app as default recommendation  
**Rationale**:
- 5-minute deployment (fastest)
- $5/month or free credits
- Zero DevOps knowledge needed
- Perfect for portfolio showcase
